        <h3>At the Global Level </h3>
        <p>
            The most common use of CSS custom properties is to define global variables 
            at the :root level, so they can be easily accessed anywhere in your stylesheet.
             Local variables, on the other hand, are defined within a specific 
             selector and are only accessible within that selector’s scope. 
             To define a CSS custom property, we must prefix the property key with 
             two dashes. For demonstration purposes, you will often see variables 
             defined on :root, but you can use them anywhere.

          <h3>In CSS Rules</h3>
          <p>Custom properties in CSS are a powerful tool that can help make your 
            styles more modular, reusable, and maintainable. To use custom properties 
            in your CSS, you first need to define your custom properties. 
            Custom properties are defined using the “_”prefix followed by a name 
            for your variable. By defining your custom properties at the top of 
            your CSS file or in a separate file, you can easily locate and update 
            them as needed, this can help make your style more modular and easier 
            to maintain.</p>

        <h3>Inside Media Queries</h3>
        <p>The most common use of media queries is to adjust the layout of a website 
            based on the width of the viewport. This allows you to create breakpoints 
            where the design changes to different screen sizes. We can also use 
            custom properties with media queries. For example, you can use custom 
            properties to define light and dark color schemes, and to change the 
            base font size for screen versus print.</p>

        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In short, CSS custom properties are ideal for creating maintainable, 
            and responsive designs. Whether you are working with global styles, 
            themes, or responsive layouts, custom properties can significantly 
            streamline your CSS and provide greater flexibility in how your site 
            or application is styled. CSS Custom Properties are not limited to simple 
            color or size declarations. You can use them for a wide range of properties, 
            including margins, padding gradients, and even complex calculations.</p>
